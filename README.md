## Introduction
This repository contains the final project report for CS432/532, focusing on the impact of COVID-19 and layoff rates on a company's financial performance and employee morale. The project aims to analyze funding and acquisition rates of companies, investigate the vulnerability of low-funding companies to bankruptcy, and perform a data-driven analysis of COVID-19's impact on employee sentiments.

## Problem
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the global economy, leading to challenges for businesses of all sizes and industries. This project addresses the following key aspects:

1. **Analyzing Funding and Acquisition Rates:**
   Identify companies with high funding and low layoff rates during COVID-19, understanding their strategies for sustained growth and financial stability.

2. **Investigating Low-Funding Companies' Vulnerability to Bankruptcy:**
   Explore the impact of COVID-19 on low-funding companies with high layoff rates despite low COVID-19 cases.

3. **Data-Driven Analysis of Employee Sentiments:**
   Calculate employee morale based on funding, layoff rates, and COVID-19 cases to understand the impact on mental well-being.

## Software Design and Implementation
### NoSQL Database and Tools
- MongoDB: Used as the primary NoSQL database with data hosted on MongoDB Atlas Cluster.
- Python Libraries: 
  - pymongo: For interacting with MongoDB from Python.
  - scipy.stats: For statistical analysis.
  - matplotlib: For data visualization.
  - numpy: For numerical computations.

### Implemented Parts
1. **Funding and Acquisition Analysis:**
   - Objective: Identify companies that achieved sustained growth and maintained financial stability during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - Steps:
     - Extracted data from the "covid_layoff_analysis" collection in the MongoDB database.
     - Filtered companies in Series A, Series B, Series C, Seed, and Growth stages with funding greater than 80% of the average funds raised by all companies.
     - Grouped the data by company, funding stage, funds raised, and industry.
     - Calculated COVID-19 cases, employee count, layoff count, and average layoff percentage for each group.
     - Filtered the data to include only companies with COVID-19 cases greater than or equal to 20,000, total employees less than or equal to 5,000, and average layoff percentage less than or equal to 5.
     - Sorted the data by average layoff percentage in ascending order and projected the relevant fields.
   - Formula used to calculate the company acquisition rate: `company_acquisition_rate = [((d['employee_total_count'] * (1 - (1/d['funds_raised'])) * (100 - d['avg_layoff_percentage'])) / d['covid_cases']) * 300 for d in result_1]`.

2. **Vulnerability Analysis of Low-Funding Companies to Bankruptcy:**
   - Objective: Assess the risk of bankruptcy for low-funding companies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - Steps:
     - Extracted data from the "covid_layoff_analysis" collection in the MongoDB database.
     - Filtered companies not in Seed, Series A, Series B, Series C, Acquired, Bankruptcy, Discontinued, or Growth stages with funding less than 80% of the average funds raised by other companies.
     - Grouped the remaining companies by company, funding stage, funds raised, and industry.
     - Calculated the sum of COVID-19 cases, maximum employee count, maximum layoff count, and average layoff percentage for each group.
     - Filtered the data to include only companies with no more than 20,000 COVID-19 cases and an average layoff percentage of at least 5.
     - Sorted the results by average layoff percentage in descending order and projected the relevant fields.
   - Formula used to calculate the company bankruptcy rate: `company_bankruptcy_rate = [((d['employee_total_count'] * (1 - (1/d['funds_raised'])) * (100 - d['avg_layoff_percentage'])) / d['covid_cases']) * 50 for d in result_2]`.

3. **Data-Driven Analysis of COVID-19's Impact on Employee Sentiments:**
   - Objective: Measure the impact of the pandemic, company performance, and layoff rates on employee morale.
   - Steps:
     - Extracted data from the "covid_layoff_analysis" collection in the MongoDB database.
     - Filtered companies not in Discontinued, Acquired, Bankruptcy, Growth, Private Equity, Private, or Public stages and with more than 0 employees.
     - Grouped the data by company, funding stage, and funds raised.
     - Calculated the sum of COVID-19 cases, maximum employee count, maximum layoff count, and average layoff percentage for each group.
     - Added a field for employee morale based on conditions derived from funds raised, layoff percentage, and COVID-19 cases.

## Project Outcome
The data analysis results are presented with easy-to-understand graphs and tables for each part of the analysis. The project provides valuable insights for businesses facing the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, helping them understand factors that contribute to financial instability and employee morale and providing strategies to navigate through uncertain times.
